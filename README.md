# Extremely-Large-Numbers-Management-System
Data structure that allows you to have numbers larger than int64 in C++.
It is based on the fact that numbers are stored in the form of a vector of digits.

Speed is not very fast, but it is fast enough for small programs.
Current performance level: much slower than Python, but at least works
Python files are included to generate performance tests.

Now it includes:
- comparsion, 
- addition 
- subtraction 
- multiplication

Math operations:
- Absolute value of number

More capabilities will be added sooner.
